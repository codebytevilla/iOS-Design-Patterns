## Clear Explanation

### Purpose:

The Factory Method Design Pattern addresses the need to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. Instead of directly calling a constructor to create an object, the Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This promotes flexibility and encapsulation, allowing the client code to work with an interface and defer the instantiation details to subclasses.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Abstract Creator:

Start by defining an abstract creator class or protocol that declares the Factory Method. This method should return an object of an interface type.

```swift
protocol Creator {
    func createProduct() -> Product
}
```

#### 2. Concrete Creators:

Create concrete creator classes that implement the Factory Method to produce specific products.

```swift
class ConcreteCreatorA: Creator {
    func createProduct() -> Product {
        return ConcreteProductA()
    }
}

class ConcreteCreatorB: Creator {
    func createProduct() -> Product {
        return ConcreteProductB()
    }
}
```

#### 3. Abstract Product:

Define an abstract product protocol or class that represents the interface of the products created by the factory.

```swift
protocol Product {
    func operation()
}
```

#### 4. Concrete Products:

Implement concrete product classes that conform to the abstract product interface.

```swift
class ConcreteProductA: Product {
    func operation() {
        print("Operation performed by ConcreteProductA")
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB: Product {
    func operation() {
        print("Operation performed by ConcreteProductB")
    }
}
```

### Working:

1. The client code interacts with the abstract creator, invoking the Factory Method without knowing the concrete class of the created product.

```swift
let creatorA: Creator = ConcreteCreatorA()
let productA = creatorA.createProduct()
productA.operation()
```

2. The concrete creator's Factory Method is called, creating an instance of the concrete product.

3. The client code can use the product through its common interface, ensuring that it can work with any product created by a concrete creator.

The Factory Method pattern provides a way to delegate the responsibility of instantiating objects to subclasses, allowing for the creation of families of related products without specifying their concrete classes in the client code. This promotes extensibility and maintainability by enabling the addition of new products or variations without modifying existing client code.
